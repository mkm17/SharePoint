The new version of the extension (1.0.14) introduces import and export functionality for Power Automate actions.

![Import Export Feature](/images/powerAutomateExtension/version114/importExport.png)

<br />
<br />

With this new feature, users can now:

- **Export favorites actions** - Save your recorded Power Automate actions to a file for later use, sharing with team members, or creating reusable action templates.

- **Import actions** - Load previously exported actions back into the extension, allowing you to quickly reproduce complex workflows without manual recreation.

- **Share workflows easily** - Exchange action sequences with colleagues, making it easier to standardize processes and collaborate on workflow development.
  
<br />
<br />

This functionality is particularly useful for:
- Creating templates for frequently used action sequences
- Documenting and sharing best practices across teams
- Backing up complex workflows before making changes
- Migrating actions between different environments

<br />
<br />

The export file is organized in JSON format. This allows users to edit specific actions and reuse them in Power Automate.
