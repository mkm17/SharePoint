The new version of the extension (1.0.11) introduces a feature to save actions as favorites. This allows users to persistently store frequently used actions and quickly add them to their flows.

<br />

Additionally, in the new Power Automate editor, the single action structure has changed slightly, causing the issue where the extension could not paste saved actions correctly. This has been fixed in this version.
