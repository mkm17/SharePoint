The new version of the extension (1.0.15) adds a **Predefined Actions** feature. This feature helps teams create workflows faster with ready-to-use action templates.

<br />
<br />

With this new feature, users can now:

- **Set a list of common actions for your team** - Create a shared list of Power Automate actions that everyone on your team can use.

- **Set actions as guidelines for your team** - Create standard action patterns that show team members the best way to work.

- **Share knowledge of difficult actions** - Help your team learn about complex Power Automate actions and share tips with each other.

- **Help new team members start quickly** - Give new people ready-made actions and templates so they can start working on Power Automate projects faster.

<br />
<br />

**How to set up the predefined actions JSON file:**

1. The file uses the same format as favorites. Add all actions you need to favorites, then export them to a new JSON file.

2. Save the file in a place where all team members can access it (for example: shared drive, SharePoint, or team repository).

3. Work together with your team to add more actions and improve your list over time.


You can test the feature using the sample file currently stored in the extension's GitHub repository: [sharepoint-actions.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkm17/powerautomate-actions-extension/refs/heads/main/sharepoint-actions.json)
