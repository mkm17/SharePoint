The new version of the extension (1.0.12) introduces some minor enhancements, allowing users to better manage their saved actions.

The first enhancement is a search functionality across all tabs, enabling users to filter actions by title. This improves usability, especially for those with a large number of saved actions.

<br />

Another improvement is the ability to view an action’s details by clicking the info button next to its name.

This allows users to quickly preview the action’s configuration and copy only the necessary parts of the saved action.

In the next release, I plan to add support for extension settings that override certain default behaviors.
